.post("/login", passport.authenticate("local"), loginUser) 

> for the very first time we will see the user with all data means serialize funtion is not run
so we get all data in res.

and after the first response the serialize funtion run and we see the only id and user (whatever we have mentioned in that functions.)

ex : response when user login for first time 
  
user :  {
  _id: new ObjectId("6577144395eb83ec6d78d86d"),
  email: 'skv222132@gmail.com',
  password: 'Saurabh@222',
  role: 'user',
  addresses: [],
  orders: [],
  __v: 0
}

>>>>after the login 

 user : { id: '6577144395eb83ec6d78d86d', role: 'user' }

       > serialize funtion eleminates other unnessasary data.
